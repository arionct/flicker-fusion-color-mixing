To mix two (or more) rgb colors, one would typically take the arithmetic mean of the respective rgb values to create the new color. For example, to mix red (255, 0, 0) with blue (0, 0, 255), take the average of each component: $r = \frac{255 + 0}{2}$


 This simulates color mixing by rapidly alternating different colors. The current implementation allows the user to choose up to 6 colors to mix using a color wheel.
